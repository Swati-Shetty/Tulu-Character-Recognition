##Digitizing Tulu

A deep learning project for handwritten Tulu script recognition using Vision Transformers (ViT) to support cultural preservation and digital accessibility.
________________________________________
##Overview

This project builds an AI system that can recognize handwritten Tulu characters from images.
It uses a Vision Transformer (ViT) model trained on a custom dataset of Tulu and similar Dravidian scripts (Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam).
